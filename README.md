Full Analysis on Airbnb Dataset 
Airbnb Dataset
 “Airbnb's mission is to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere”
It is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Since 2008 a lot of hosts and guests have used Airbnb for stay purpose to travel conveniently and lead a professional view of life, now it became one of the world’s largest service that is recognized by everyone
I chose this dataset because, since Airbnb has become large and it needs some changes based on the customers reviews, by analysing the data Airbnb can take business decisions, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of additional services and much more.
2.Domain Idea
The dataset I have chosen comes under online marketplace and hospitality service. This dataset was taken from Kaggle and is easy to use with no restrictions whereas some organisations doesn’t provide the data, data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. The main idea is to improve the Airbnb System from customer reviews from different places, improving their business from visualizing the data and to take it the advance level by improving all of its services from its dataset.

This Airbnb ('AB_NYC_2019') dataset for the 2019 year is a very rich dataset with a variety of columns that allowed us to do deep data exploration on each significant column presented. Overall, we will discover a very good number of interesting relationships between features and explained each step of the process. This data analytics is very much mimicked on a higher level on Airbnb Data/Machine Learning team for better business decisions, control over the platform, marketing initiatives, implementation of new features and much more. Therefore, I hope this kernel helps everyone
